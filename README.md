# Socioeconomic and Deprivation Analysis – Orkney Islands Council

## Overview
This Power BI project was developed during my internship with **Orkney Islands Council** to analyse
socioeconomic conditions, deprivation levels, population distribution, and accessibility to essential services
across Orkney data zones.

The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for policy development, community planning,
and identification of priority areas for intervention.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyse geographic patterns of population and deprivation
- Compare income, employment, and education deprivation across data zones
- Segment communities using ACORN demographic classifications
- Assess accessibility to essential services such as GP practices and petrol stations
- Provide an overall summary view to support strategic decision-making

---

## Key Insights
- Certain data zones consistently exhibit higher income and employment deprivation
- Financially Stretched and Comfortable Communities represent the largest population segments
- Income and employment deprivation trends vary significantly across community types
- Geographic clustering highlights areas with compounded socioeconomic challenges
- Accessibility to essential services differs across locations, indicating potential service gaps
- The overall summary dashboard identifies high-priority zones for targeted policy action
